Acme Bike Rentals manages rentals for various kinds of bikes. They keep track of
such information as the bike’s number, make, model, type (racer, mountain bike,
tandem, etc), gender (men’s/women’s), rental deposit, daily rental charge, renter
information, etc. The shop sells or rents various accessories, such as bike helmets
and detachable baskets. They also maintain customer records. When a bike is
rented, the renter will specify the rental duration and will pay the bike’s deposit
fee and the rental cost for the estimated rental duration. When the bike is
returned late, additional rental charges are applied at the time of return. The
shop will print a receipt for a rental which may consist of multiple items. When
new bikes are ordered, an electronic list is provided to the bike shop to correspond
to the shipment.
